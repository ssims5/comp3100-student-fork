# COMP 3100 — Semester Schedule

**Operating Systems · Fall 2026 · Harding University**
*"The Case Files of the Grand Analytical Engine"*

This page is the **authoritative list of dates** for the course. Decks,
work orders, and commission cover pages all point back here; if a date
anywhere else disagrees with this page, this page wins. Anything that
changes will be changed here first and announced in class and on Canvas.

## How a normal week runs

| When | What |
|---|---|
| **Before Wednesday's class** | That week's **zyBooks reading** (participation + challenge activities) is due. |
| **Monday** | Episode deck: the week's story beat, then the concept lecture, then the briefing for the week's work order. |
| **Wednesday & Friday** | Studio. You work the work order at your own machine; the instructor circulates. |
| **Sunday, 11:59 pm** | **Work order deliverables due on Canvas:** your `logbook.md` for the week (wax seals pasted in) plus your updated running `case-notes.md`. |

Commissions (the five department projects) are **submitted in zyBooks**,
not Canvas, and are due at **11:59 pm** on the date listed below.

## Three calendar facts worth circling now

1. **Labor Day, Monday, September 7 — class *is* held.** We meet that
   Monday; the Enginehouse takes no holiday. Episode 4 runs as normal.
2. **Fall break, Friday, October 2 — no class.** Week 7 has only two
   sessions (Mon Sep 28 and Wed Sep 30), and its work order is sized for
   two sessions. **Nothing is due over the break: Week 7's deliverables
   move to Monday, October 5, at 11:59 pm.** This is the only week all
   semester that does not turn in on a Sunday. Week 8 begins that same
   Monday as normal.
3. **Thanksgiving, Monday–Friday, November 23–27 — no class all week.**
   Nothing is due that week. The Engine rests; so do you.

Finals week is **December 7–11**. Guild Examination II meets in the
registrar's assigned slot, announced in class and posted in Canvas.
**Nothing else is due that week** — no work order, no commission, no
reading. The last deadline of the semester is Friday, December 4.

**Reading the table.** "Work Order *NN*" means the week's lab: submit
`logbook.md` and your updated `case-notes.md` on Canvas by 11:59 pm
Friday — except in Week 7, where fall break pushes the deadline to
Monday, October 5. A work order's number is its week's number, so there
are **fourteen graded work orders** — one every week except exam week,
and no Work Order 08. None are dropped. The exact zyBooks activity list
for each week is posted in Canvas alongside the chapter range above.

**Class meetings.** The course meets **44 times**: three days a week
across the fifteen teaching weeks, less Friday, October 2 for fall
break. That number is what the professionalism component in
[`syllabus.md`](syllabus.md) is scored against.

## The five Guild Commissions at a glance

These are the department's own projects, unmodified. Dr. Foust's spec is
authoritative for each one; the course adds only a cover page and the
calendar placement below. **All five are submitted in zyBooks.**

| # | zyBooks | Project | In-fiction name | Assigned | Due (11:59 pm) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 12.1 | Mr. Kureos | *The Census of the Enginehouse* | Mon Aug 24 (Wk 2) | **Fri Sep 18** (Wk 5) |
| 2 | 12.2 | HUSH | *The Speaking-Tube Console* | Mon Sep 14 (Wk 5) | **Fri Oct 16** (Wk 9) |
| 3 | 12.3 | Regular Expressions | *The Pattern Loom* | Mon Oct 12 (Wk 9) | **Fri Oct 30** (Wk 11) |
| 4 | 12.5 | Simple Versioning System | *The Revision Registry* | Mon Oct 26 (Wk 11) | **Fri Nov 20** (Wk 14) |
| 5 | 12.4 | A Good Sport | *The Exchange Audit* | Mon Nov 9 (Wk 13) | **Fri Dec 4** (Wk 15) |

An **open HUSH workshop** runs Friday, Oct 9 — bring your half-finished
shell and questions. The last two commissions run long on purpose: they
run through the applied weeks (12–15), which carry no required reading,
so the load moves from the reading to the projects. Each gets about
twenty-five days, and they land a fortnight apart — **neither one falls
in finals week**, where nothing is due but Exam II.

## Exams

| Exam | When | Covers | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Guild Examination I** | Wednesday, October 7 (Wk 8), in class | zyBooks Ch 1–5 and the work orders through Week 7 | 15% |
| **Guild Examination II** | Finals week, Dec 7–11 · slot set by the registrar, announced in class | zyBooks Ch 6–8, plus lighter coverage of the applied weeks (12–14) | 15% |

Both exams are written in the Guild's voice; the questions are ordinary
operating-systems questions. Nothing on either exam requires you to have
followed the story.
