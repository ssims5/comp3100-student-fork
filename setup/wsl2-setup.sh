# COMP-3100 -- provision a WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 with the full course toolchain.
#
# This provisions the course's primary Windows environment. On Windows the
# course runs on WSL2 (see setup/getting-started.md, "Path A -- Windows: WSL2").
# Path A normally provisions itself automatically from setup/wsl.user-data on
# first boot; run this script when you want to (re)install the toolchain by
# hand -- the documented repair path if that first-boot setup didn't finish.
#
# It installs the same tools the macOS Multipass VM's cloud-init.yaml installs,
# so a WSL2 student and a Mac student get the same environment (as closely as
# WSL2 allows).
#
# Run it from INSIDE your WSL2 Ubuntu shell, from the repo root:
#
#     bash setup/wsl2-setup.sh
#
# It uses sudo; you will be asked for your WSL password once. Re-running it
# is safe.
#
# ONE KNOWN LIMIT: perf hardware counters (cycles, instructions,
# cache-misses) do not work under WSL2 -- the WSL kernel exposes no CPU PMU.
# Everything else in the course works. See the note printed at the end.
